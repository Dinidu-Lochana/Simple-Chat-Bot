Question,Answer
What is machine learning?,Machine learning is a subset of AI that develops algorithms enabling computers to learn from data and make decisions without explicit programming.
What is deep learning?,Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers to analyze complex patterns in large datasets.
What are the three types of machine learning?,"The three types are supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning."
What is a neural network composed of?,"A neural network consists of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer, with interconnected nodes performing computations."
What are some applications of machine learning?,"Applications include healthcare (disease diagnosis), finance (credit scoring), and marketing (customer segmentation)."
What are common uses of deep learning?,"Deep learning is used in computer vision, natural language processing, and autonomous systems like self-driving cars."
What is overfitting in machine learning?,Overfitting occurs when a model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data.
What is explainable AI (XAI)?,"Explainable AI aims to make AI models, especially deep learning models, more transparent and interpretable."
